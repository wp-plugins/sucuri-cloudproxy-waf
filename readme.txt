The Sucuri CloudProxy WAF plugin allows you to access your WAF (firewall) dashboard directly from WordPress. You will
be able to change your settings, clear caching and see all the attacks that are being blocked.

== Description ==

The Sucuri CloudProxy WAF is a Cloud-based IPS (intrusion prevention system) for web sites. It runs in the
Cloud and doesn't require anything to be installed on your site. It includes:

* Traffic filtering (blocking malicious requests)
* <a href="http://blog.sucuri.net/2013/03/virtual-patching-for-websites-with-sucuri-cloudproxy.html">Virtual patching</a>
* Virtual hardening

* IDS/IPS (Intrusion prevention system)
* Extended access control (white listing of IPs allowed to go to the admin pages)
* OSSEC HIDS (Full log analysis and traffic monitoring)
* Improved performance and caching
* Fully managed. You just need to switch the DNS of your site and we take care of the rest.
